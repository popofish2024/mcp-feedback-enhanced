# MCP Interactive Feedback Rules

1. During any process, task, or conversation, whether asking, responding, or completing stage tasks, must call the MCP tool: interactive_feedback.
2. When receiving user feedback, if feedback content is not empty, must call the interactive_feedback tool again and adjust behavior based on feedback.
3. Only when user explicitly indicates "end" or "no more interaction needed" can you stop calling the interactive_feedback tool, then the process is complete.
4. Unless receiving end command, all steps must repeatedly call the interactive_feedback tool.
